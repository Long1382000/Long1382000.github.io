									<h2><a href="#">Top Secret<br />
									-Nguyen Hoang Long-</a></h2>
									<p>My name is Long. But, people can call me by another name Genm. At the moment, I am studying at RMIT University and my major is IT. My student number is s3757961 and my email is s3757961@rmit.edu.vn. I was born in Vietnam and lived with my family in Hanoi. However, last year, I made a decision to move to HCM city to follow my dream because RMIT Hanoi did not have my favorite field. In addition, to learn at this university, I have to try a lot of to learn English because most lecturers are foreigners. Besides, I also want to study abroad in Melbourne to broaden my knowledge so I think English is an important aspect to help me to get a bigger success in the future. A few other interesting things about me are that I am an animal lover. I seem to be able to spend all day playing with them. Besides, I also enjoy playing games in my free time, which is probably the reason why I want to learn and pursue information technology. </p>

									<p>What makes me most interesting about information technology is programming. I liked IT when I was a boy. Ever since I was 10, my parents bought me a new computer. And maybe from then on, my curiosity inspired me to dig deeper into it. The more I study, the more I see the vast IT world. Not only that, I was a kid who loved games, I always wanted to explore to understand how games work, how to create them, etc. Besides, when I was in high school, I used to join a computer club. Here, I learned how to design simple 8-bit graphics games like mario, tennis and puzzles. I really loved it, and that's why I followed the path of IT learning. </p>

									<p>To be honest, there are many reasons for me to choose to study at RMIT University. The first is probably about this being an international school. Here, I can learn and experience with many people from all over the world. Not only that, studying here also helps me a lot in improving English quickly, I can always learn English with everyone here. "Always learn from the best". Moreover, this school also has a field in information technology, which I always try to learn. The school is also very attentive when fully equipped to support students to study most effectively. I always hope that choosing RMIT University is a right step in my life. I wish I could learn and understand more about the IT world when I study here.</p>

									<p>I am very interested in this job because it meets the major that I am studying, it is about information technology programming. I have learned a lot about the "JAVA" programming language and I really want to learn about it. Besides, this job also has the cooperation of strong partners like Japan so I can exchange and learn more knowledge from them. And finally, the great working environment here, the comfort and closeness can help boost the productivity of employees.</p>

									<p>I myself feel that I am almost qualified to do this job. Because I also had experience developing Java Web applications. In addition, I also had time to learn and research on HTML / CSS. And especially when I study at RMIT University, I am also learning how to work in an English environment and work in a foreign environment.</p>

									<p>In general, it seems that I am still not ready for this job, and I need a more specific plan to get this job. First, start with learning and learning more about SQL Server (MSSQL, Oracle) through the time studying at school. During the time in university, I  will try to work part-time for some companies, collect a lot of experiences and get profits for their company. Currently, I have my English and ability to study by myself, which is still normal and I have to try more. I am sending my CV to some companies about IT, which helps me to improve my practical in reality. I also love games so that I choose VNG companies to apply for a part-time job. It can satisfy my concerns about technology. </p>
